The Worldinator
=======================

Experiment with procedural world generation.

Written in C or C-ish C++.

Work in progress - do not expect particularly nice code. I'm doing this to learn and because it's fun. :)

Latest generated world

TODO
----

* Histogram matching
* Better gradients
* Distance to equator/poles
* Distance to water
* Rivers
* Lighting
* More biomes

... and lots more. This is mainly a reminder to me for things to do in the "near" future.
